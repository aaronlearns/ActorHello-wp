# ActorHello-wp
The ActorHello theme fit for Wordpress

My original inspiration for this template came a few years ago.
I was a new grad from drama school and I was trying to establish an online presence.
I felt that Wordpress was the best service, but they didn't have a theme for actors!
So I surveyed my teachers and peers, asking them what they thought an actor's website should have,
and I made a Wordpress theme based around those criteria.
There's space for a gallery, reel, as well as contact info and a link to a resume.
