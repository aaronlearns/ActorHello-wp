# ActorHello-wp
The ActorHello theme fit for Wordpress using PHP

My original inspiration for this template came a few years ago.  
I was a new grad from drama school and I was trying to establish an online presence.  
I felt that Wordpress was the best service, but they didn't have a theme for actors!  
So I surveyed my teachers and peers, asking them what they thought an actor's website should have, and I made a Wordpress theme based around those criteria.  
  
There's space to see the actor's work as well as contact info and a link to a resume. URL for the static template below:
